Simple Steel Mod

This mod adds a new tier of tools and armor: Steel. A Steel ingot can be made by smelting an iron ingot, but be
warned: steel can only be made into tools and armor. Smelting iron hardens it, meaning your steel tools and armor
are more durable than iron, but the process also strips all other useful properties from iron. Steel cannot be used to
make most things that iron can, such as minecarts, compasses, doors, and more. Also, beacons are not responsive to
steel, so you cannot use steel in the construction of a beacon's pyramid. Finally, steel is much harder to shape, so
you cannot smelt your old tools and armor down into nuggets. You'll do well to keep these things in mind as you use and
make steel. Now, get out there and use your steel tools and armor with confidence, knowing they're much more durable
than your old iron gear.
